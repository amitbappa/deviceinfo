In this sample device information and Web RTC with real time data communication with remote and local.

For WebRTC:
As you start the app the first steps it takes is creating the PeerConnection between the simulated Local Peer and Remote Peer. 
As soon as the PeerConnection is established, the DataChannel for each peer is created and "connected". Thus possibilitating the exchange of messages as shown on the app screen.
